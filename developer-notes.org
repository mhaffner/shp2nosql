* TODO
- [ ] Make install script/.deb install package
  - [ ] add shp2nosql to path
- [ ] More testing on virtual machines
- [ ] Change all /echo/ to /printf/?
- [ ] Need to only replace first instance with sed in input-mapping func?? ->
- [ ] Make all errors go to stderr and exit
- [ ] Make download available for census blocks and block groups?
- [ ] Suppress elasticsearch output while in scripts?
- [ ] Create option for spatial index on mongodb data after indexing?
- [ ] How to deal with 413 errors?
- [ ] How to handle alternative character sets?
- [ ] Save parameters to a file?
- [ ] Allow users to specify their own geojson instead of shapefile -> call this
  geojson2nosql -> probably not practical as =ogr2ogr= formats the
  .geojson in a desirable way, and this wouldn't be guaranteed otherwise
- [X] Move shp2nosql executable to ./bin folder
- [X] Split tools up into shp2mongo and shp2es
- [X] Make a bin folder for shp2nosql?
  -> be sure to modify PATH location if this is done
- [X] Use Docker? -> Nah
- [X] Test on virtual machines
- [X] Make wget command more robust (use postgis book example) -> not really
  necessary 
- [X] Make documentation more robust
- [X] Allow remote host with esbulk
- [X] Test multiline submission scripts
- [X] Change all ftp... to www2...
- [X] Source other functions in? -> not for now
- [X] Improve documentation -> Make -h option cat part of the readme -> Instead,
  the README just links to help.txt
- [X] Make script executable
- [X] Allow users to specify a group of files -> this will be a lot of work
- [X] Add ~/git-repos/shp2nosql to path
- [X] drop the .sh
- [X] Make script executable
- [X] Rename ip_address variable?
- [X] Check if service is running and throw an error to user if it is
  not -> not messing with this right now. Many different programs
  exist to do this (e.g. systemctl, service, etc.). Not worth the hassle
- [X] Make error appear if tract is specified with no fips code
- [X] Use something other than wget? -> don't mess with it right now
  - axel (might have to build from source on some systems though)
  - Make this an option; check for its installation
- [X] Check software license of Stack Overflow material -> cc by-sa 3.0
- [X] How to handle deleting index before inputting new?? If users are using
  census data, they probably want to create a new index and delete the old (but
  it is possible that they may not want to); They may want to just add to an
  existing index
- [X] Quote all variables
- [X] Allow user to specify whether or not they want to use esbulk
- [X] Use dashes for all functions, underscores for all variables
- [X] Try new shapefile (OK congressional districts may have malformed geometry)
- [X] Verify .geojson in lint or GIS
- [X] How to handle alternative SRS's? -> EPSG:4236 is standard for GeoJSON
- [X] Need to delete first 4 lines instead of first 3 now that custom SRS has
  been specified in ogr2ogr
- [X] Make all SRS outputs EPSG:4326 (this is standard for GeoJSON)
- [X] Make is_local an option with no argument required
- [X] Add option for IP address and port
- [X] Adjust curl statement
- [X] Get rid of quotes around first line of mapping-template (cat may be
  producing this) -> nope, I had single quotes around the text
- [X] Use esbulk to insert records if installed?
- [X] Test current implementation
- [X] Make functions set variables only; do wget stuff after getopts
