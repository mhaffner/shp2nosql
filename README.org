* shp2nosql
This package is a set of command line utilities for working with geospatial data
and NoSQL databases such as Elasticsearch and MongoDB. It is designed to be
fairly standardized with reasonable defaults so that the intricacies of
inserting/indexing geospatial data (mainly shapefiles) need not be mastered for
each individual database.
